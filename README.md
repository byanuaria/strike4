# strike4

This project presents an investigation of MLB umpire bias, specifically how the count and previous call influences an umpire's decision on the following pitch. This project was inspired by a [FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/four-strikes-and-youre-out/), which was adapted from a [paper](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014_SSAC_What-Does-it-Take-to-Call-a-Strike.pdf) presented at the [2014 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/content/what-does-it-take-to-call-a-strike-three-biases-in-umpire-decision-making/).
